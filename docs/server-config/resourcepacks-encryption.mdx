# Resource Pack Encryption

Nukkit-MOT supports the use of encrypted resource packs to protect your work. This guide will help you configure resource pack encryption in three simple steps.

:::caution Note for Beginners
This encryption is based on the AES symmetric algorithm. While it can effectively enhance the security of your resource pack, it cannot completely prevent professional methods such as packet sniffing from cracking it.
:::

## 📦 Encrypt the Resource Pack \{#encrypt-resource-pack}
{/* It is recommended to use the [encryptmypack](https://encryptmypack.com) online tool for encryption. The process is as follows:
1. Prepare a resource pack that meets the requirements:
   - Must be in `.mcpack` format
   - The `manifest.json` file must be directly visible after extraction (not nested in a subfolder)
2. Upload it to the encryption website to generate an encrypted pack */}
It is recommended to use the open-source command-line tool EncryptMyPack for encryption. The process is as follows:

1. **Download the Tool**  
   Download the latest version of the program from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/AllayMC/EncryptMyPack/releases/latest).
2. **Prepare the Resource Pack**  
   - Must be in `.zip` format (you can directly rename a .mcpack file)
   - The root directory of the zip file must contain the `manifest.json` file
   - Supports including sub-packs (Sub Packs)
3. **Encryption**

inputZip is the full name of the input zip file, e.g., `example.zip`

outputZip is the full name of the output zip file, e.g., `example.zip`

key is a custom 32-bit key. If no key is specified, the default key `liulihaocai123456789123456789123` will be used.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
```bash
EncryptMyPack.exe encrypt <inputZip> <outputZip> [key]
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
```bash
EncryptMyPack encrypt <inputZip> <outputZip> [key]
```
</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
Add executable permissions
```bash
chmod +x EncryptMyPack
```
Then you can proceed with the following command:
```bash
./EncryptMyPack encrypt <inputZip> <outputZip> [key]
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip Important Reminder
Nukkit-MOT is only responsible for passing the key to the client and does not participate in the actual encryption/decryption process.
:::

## 🔑 Configure the Encryption Key \{#configure-key}
1. In the server's `resource_packs` folder,
2. Create a `.key` file with the same name as the encrypted pack.
3. Paste the 32-bit encryption key in the .key file.

<FolderView
  paths={[
    'resource_packs/ExampleResourcePack.mcpack',
    'resource_packs/ExampleResourcePack.mcpack.key'
  ]}
/>

## 🔄 Restart the Server \{#restart-server}
After modifying the configuration, you must restart the server for the encryption to take effect (Nukkit-MOT only loads resource pack configurations at startup).

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions
| Question | Answer |
|------|------|
| Can the encrypted resource pack be cracked? | It may be cracked by professional methods, but it is much more secure than an unencrypted resource pack. |
| Does encryption affect game performance? | It does not affect client or server performance at all. |
| Are multiple encrypted packs supported? | Yes, you can deploy multiple encrypted packs simultaneously, each requiring a corresponding .key file. |

:::success Done!
Now, when your players load the resource pack, the client will automatically use the configured key to decrypt and load it.
